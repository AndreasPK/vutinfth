             by Thomas Auzinger <thomas.auzinger@cg.tuwien.ac.at>


Description
-----------
The vutinfth document class is a LaTeX2e-based template for all theses written
at the Faculty of Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology. This
package includes the document class and its documentation as well as an example
document that includes a short introduction to LaTeX.


Support
-------
The vutinfth document class is developed using a GitLab-supported Git
repository. You can find it at
                https://gitlab.cg.tuwien.ac.at/auzinger/vutinfth
where a history of the development process is given. If you encounter problems
with using vutinfth, use the Issues section of GitLab to provide a description
and to alert the developers of your issue. Furthermore, you can use the Issues
section to request features or give suggestions.


Installation
------------
To use the vutinfth class, it has first to be generated from the documented
source file vutinfth.dtx. This is achieved by executing the build script for
Windows systems (build.bat) or Unix-based systems (build.sh). The generated
document class vutinfth.cls has then to be placed in a directory that is part
of the search path of the LaTeX compiler. The folder of the thesis file is a
valid location.
The build script also generate an exemplary LaTeX document that serves both as
an introduction to LaTeX and as a verification of the installed typesetting
system. The example document is compiled to example.pdf and it should match the
provided reference solution example-ref.pdf.


Documentation
-------------
The documentation can be found in vutinfth.pdf, which is generated directly
from vutinfth.dtx.
