\chapter{Introduction to \LaTeX}

Since \LaTeX\ is widely used in academia and industry, there exists a plethora of freely accessible introductions to the language.
Reading through the guide at \url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX} serves as a comprehensive overview for most of the functionality and is highly recommended before starting with a thesis in \LaTeX.

\section{Installation}

A full \LaTeX\ distribution\index{distribution} consists of not only of the binaries that convert the source files to the typeset documents, but also of a wide range of packages and their documentation.
Depending on the operating system, different implementations are available as shown in Table~\ref{tab:distrib}.
\textbf{Due to the large amount of packages that are in everyday use and due to their high interdependence, it is paramount to keep the installed distribution\index{distribution} up to date.}
Otherwise, obscure errors and tedious debugging ensue.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    Distribution & Unix         & Windows      & MacOS        \\
    \midrule
    TeX Live     & \textbf{yes} & yes          & (yes)        \\
    MacTeX       & no           & no           & \textbf{yes} \\
    MikTeX       & no           & \textbf{yes} & no           \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\TeX/\LaTeX\ distributions for different operating systems. Recomended choice in \textbf{bold}.}
  \label{tab:distrib} % \label has to be placed AFTER \caption to produce correct cross-references.
\end{table}

\section{Editors}

A multitude of \TeX\ \glspl{texteditor} are available differing in their editing models, their supported operating systems and their feature sets.
A comprehensive overview of \glspl{texteditor} can be found at the Wikipedia page  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors}.
TeXstudio (\url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/}) is recommended.
Most editors support the scrolling the typeset preview document to a location in the source document by \verb|Ctrl| clicking the location in the source document.

\section{Compilation}

Modern editors usually provide the compilation programs to generate \gls{pdf} documents and for most \LaTeX\ source files, this is sufficient.
More advanced \LaTeX\ functionality, such as glossaries and bibliographies, needs additional compilation steps, however.
It is also possible that errors in the compilation process invalidate intermediate files and force subsequent compilation runs to fail.
It is advisable to delete intermediate files (\verb|.aux|, \verb|.bbl|, etc.), if errors occur and persist.
All files that are not generated by the user are automatically regenerated.
To compile the current document, the steps as shown in Table~\ref{tab:compile} have to be taken.


\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{rl}
    \toprule
    & Description \\
    \midrule

\section{Basic Functionality}

In this section, various examples are given of the fundamental building blocks used in a thesis.
Many \LaTeX\ commands have a rich set of options that can be supplied as optional arguments.
The documentation of each command should be consulted to get an impression of the full spectrum of its functionality.

\subsection{Floats}

Two main categories of page elements can be differentiated in the usual \LaTeX\ workflow: \textit{(i)} the main stream of text and \textit{(ii)} floating containers that are positioned at convenient positions throughout the document.
In most cases, tables, plots, and images are put into such containers since they are usually positioned at the top or bottom of pages.
These are realized by the two environments \verb|figure| and \verb|table|, which also provide functionality for cross-referencing (see Table~\ref{tab:intro} and Figure~\ref{fig:intro}) and the generation of corresponding entries in the list of figures and the list of tables.
Note that these environments solely act as containers and can be assigned arbitrary content.

\subsection{Tables}

A table in \LaTeX\ is created by using a \verb|tabular| environment or any of its extensions, e.g., \verb|tabularx|.
The commands \verb|\multirow| and \verb|\multicolumn| allow table elements to span multiple rows and columns.

\begin{table}[h] % placement specifier
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Position} \\
    \cmidrule{1-2} % partial horizontal rule
    Group & Abbrev & Name \\
    \midrule
    Goalkeeper & GK & Paul Robinson \\
    \midrule
    \multirow{4}{*}{Defenders} & LB & Lucus Radebe \\
                               & DC & Michael Duburry \\
                               & DC & Dominic Matteo \\
                               & RB & Didier Domi \\
    \midrule
    \multirow{3}{*}{Midfielders} & MC & David Batty \\
                                 & MC & Eirik Bakke \\
                                 & MC & Jody Morris \\
    \midrule
    Forward & FW & Jamie McMaster \\
    \midrule
    \multirow{2}{*}{Strikers} & ST & Alan Smith \\
                              & ST & Mark Viduka \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Adapted example from the \LaTeX guide at \url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables}. This example uses rules specific to the \texttt{booktabs} package and employs the multi-row functionality of the \texttt{multirow} package.}
  \label{tab:intro} % \label has to be placed AFTER \caption to produce correct cross-references.
\end{table}

\subsection{Images}

An image is added to a document via the \verb|\includegraphics| command as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intro}.
The \verb|\subcaption| command can be used to reference subfigures, such as Figure~\ref{fig:intro:full width} and~\ref{fig:intro:half width}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TU_INF_Logo_gray}
    \subcaption{The header logo at text width.}
    \label{fig:intro:full width}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{TU_INF_Logo_gray}
    \subcaption{The header logo at half the text width.}
    \label{fig:intro:half width}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{The header logo at different sizes.}
  \label{fig:intro} % \label has to be placed AFTER \caption (or \subcaption) to produce correct cross-references.
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mathematical Expressions}

One of the original motivation to create the \TeX\ system was the need for mathematical typesetting.
To this day, \LaTeX\ is the preferred system to write math-heavy documents and a wide variety of functions aids the author in this task.
A mathematical expression can be inserted inline as $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ outside of the text stream as \[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \] or as numbered equation with
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pseudo Code}

The presentation of algorithms can be achieved with various packages; the most popular are \verb|algorithmic|, \verb|algorithm2e|, \verb|algorithmicx|, or \verb|algpseudocode|.
An overview is given at \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/229355}.
An example of the use of the \verb|alogrithm2e| package is given with Algorithm~\ref{alg:gauss-seidel}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \SetKw{BreakFor}{break for}
  \KwIn{A scalar~$\epsilon$, a matrix $\mathbf{A} = (a_{ij})$, a vector $\vec{b}$, and an initial vector $\vec{x}^{(0)}$}
  \KwOut{$\vec{x}^{(n)}$ with $\mathbf{A} \vec{x}^{(n)} \approx \vec{b}$}
  \For{$k\leftarrow 1$ \KwTo maximum iterations}
  {
     \For{$i\leftarrow 1$ \KwTo $n$}
     {
        $x_i^{(k)} = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left(b_i-\sum_{j<i} a_{ij} x_j^{(k)} - \sum_{j>i} a_{ij} x_j^{(k-1)} \right)$\;
     }
     \If{$\lvert\vec{x}^{(k)}-\vec{x}^{(k-1)}\rvert < \epsilon$}
     {\BreakFor\;}
  }
  \Return{$\vec{x}^{(k)}$\;}
  \caption{Gauss-Seidel}
  \label{alg:gauss-seidel} % \label has to be placed AFTER \caption to produce correct cross-references.
\end{algorithm}

\section{Bibliography}

The referencing of prior work is a fundamental requirement of academic writing and well supported by \LaTeX.
The \textsc{Bib}\TeX\ reference management software is the most commonly used system for this purpose.
Using the \verb|\cite| command, it is possible to reference entries in a \verb|.bib| file out of the text stream, e.g., as~\cite{Turing1936}.
The generation of the formatted bibliography needs a separate execution of \verb|bibtex.exe| (see Table~\ref{tab:compile}).

\section{Table of Contents}

The table of contents is automatically built by successive runs of the compilation, e.g., of \verb|pdflatex.exe|.
The command \verb|\setsecnumdepth| allows the specification of the depth of the table of contents and additional entries can be added to the table of contents using \verb|\addcontentsline|.
The starred versions of the sectioning commands, i.e., \verb|\chapter*|, \verb|\section*|, etc., remove the corresponding entry from the table of contents.

\section{Acronyms / Glossary / Index}

The list of acronyms, the glossary, and the index need to be built with a separate execution of \verb|makeindex| (see Table~\ref{tab:compile}).
Acronyms have to be specified with \verb|\newacronym| while glossary entries use \verb|\newglossaryentry|.
Both are then used in the document content with one of the variants of \verb|\gls|, such as \verb|\Gls|, \verb|\glspl|, or \verb|\Glspl|.
Index items are simply generated by placing \verb|\index|\marg{entry} next to all the words that correspond to the index entry \meta{entry}.
Note that many enhancements exist for these functionalities and the documentation of the \verb|makeindex| and the \verb|glossaries| packages should be consulted.

\section{Tips}

Since \TeX\ and its successors do not employ a \gls{wysiwyg} editing scheme, several guidelines improve the readability of the source content:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each sentence in the source text should start with a new line.
      This helps not only the user navigation through the text, but also enables revision control systems (e.g. \gls{svn}, Git) to show the exact changes authored by different users.
      Paragraphs are separated by one (or more) empty lines.
\item Environments, which are defined by a matching pair of \verb|\begin{name}| and \verb|\end{name}|, can be indented by whitespace to show their hierarchical structure.
\item In most cases, the explicit use of whitespace (e.g. by adding \verb|\hspace{4em}| or \verb|\vspace{1.5cm}|) violates typographic guidelines and rules.
      Explicit formatting should only be employed as a last resort and, most likely, better ways to achieve the desired layout can be found by a quick web search.
\item The use of bold or italic text is generally not supported by typographic considerations and the semantically meaningful \verb|\emph{|\texttt{$\dots$}\verb|}| should be used.
\end{itemize}

The predominant application of the \LaTeX\ system is the generation of \gls{pdf} files via the \textsc{Pdf}\LaTeX\ binaries.
In the current version of \textsc{Pdf}\LaTeX, it is possible that absolute file paths and user account names are embedded in the final \gls{pdf} document.
While this poses only a minor security issue for all documents, it is highly problematic for double blind reviews.
The process shown in Table~\ref{tab:ps2pdf} can be employed to strip all private information from the final \gls{pdf} document.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{rl}
  \toprule
  & Command \\
  \midrule
  1 & Rename the \gls{pdf} document \verb|final.pdf| to \verb|final.ps|. \\
  2 & Execute the following command: \\
    & \verb|ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS#/prepress ^| \\
    & \verb| -dCompatibilityLevel#1.4 ^| \\
    & \verb| -dAutoFilterColorImages#false ^| \\
    & \verb| -dAutoFilterGrayImages#false ^| \\
    & \verb| -dColorImageFilter#/FlateEncode ^| \\
    & \verb| -dGrayImageFilter#/FlateEncode ^| \\
    & \verb| -dMonoImageFilter#/FlateEncode ^| \\
    & \verb| -dDownsampleColorImages#false ^| \\
    & \verb| -dDownsampleGrayImages#false ^| \\
    & \verb| final.ps final.pdf| \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}

  On Unix-based systems, replace \verb|#| with \verb|=| and \verb|^| with \verb|\|.
